# Task Memory

Store vertical task plans in this folder.

Agents must create a saved task plan here before implementation. Use filenames that match the related detailed spec when practical, for example:

```txt
_task/2026-05-10-add-dark-theme.md
```

Default execution mode is `complete-workflow`: after the task plan is created, execute all generated tasks sequentially until the request/spec is complete or a stop condition is reached.

Execution modes:

- `plan-only`: ask questions, write the detailed spec, write the task plan derived from it, then stop.
- `single-task`: execute only the next ready task through the full 3-pass hardening loop, update artifacts, then stop.
- `complete-workflow`: execute all generated tasks sequentially until the request/spec is complete or a stop condition is reached.
- `parallel-workflow`: orchestrator plans tasks, creates queue/claims/locks, assigns safe tasks to worker agents, then performs merge review and final artifacts.
- `parallel-worker`: worker claims and executes exactly one eligible parallel-safe task, records final status, releases locks, and stops.
- `parallel-orchestrator`: orchestrator manages queue, validates claims/locks, reviews worker outputs, runs final verification, and completes final artifacts.

Use `single-task` only when the user explicitly asks for controlled one-task execution.

Sequential `complete-workflow` remains the fallback. Use parallel modes only when dependencies and file locks show tasks can run safely.

Task plans must be derived from the saved detailed spec, not from the raw request alone. Each task plan must cite or reference the detailed spec sections used to derive the plan, especially:

- Current State Analysis.
- Affected Surfaces.
- Dependency And Integration Map.
- Data And State Impact.
- UX / API / Workflow Expectations.
- Execution Strategy.
- Verification Strategy.
- Acceptance Criteria.
- Edge Cases And Failure Modes.
- Risks And Mitigations.
- Assumptions.
- Open Questions.
- Task Extraction Notes.

Each task must include:

- Task ID.
- Status.
- Priority: `P0`, `P1`, or `P2`.
- Parallel safe: `yes` or `no`.
- Depends on.
- Blocks.
- File locks.
- Claim status: `unclaimed`, `claimed`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked`, or `needs-review`.
- Claimed by.
- Agent role: `orchestrator`, `parallel-worker`, or another explicit role.
- Merge risk: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- Objective.
- Detailed spec sections used or referenced.
- Files likely affected.
- Checklist.
- Iteration plan for Iteration 1 Build, Iteration 2 Refine, and Iteration 3 Polish.
- Test plan.
- Red phase evidence.
- Green phase evidence.
- Refactor phase evidence.
- Test commands run.
- Acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance result.
- Verification commands.
- Stop condition.
- Out-of-scope items.

Each iteration plan must include:

- Goal.
- Changes made.
- Test plan.
- Red phase evidence.
- Green phase evidence.
- Refactor phase evidence.
- Test commands run.
- Verification command/result.
- Review findings.
- Acceptance status.
- Remaining issues.
- Next action.

## Task Status Transitions

Every task must move through:

```txt
Planned -> Ready -> In Progress -> Verified -> Reviewed -> Done
```

Allowed terminal states:

- `Done`
- `Blocked`
- `Needs Human Review`

Rules:

- A task cannot be `Done` unless all three iterations are complete, verification was attempted in each iteration, the task was reviewed in each iteration, and final acceptance is complete.
- A code-changing task cannot be `Done` unless relevant tests were added or updated first, the failing test was observed before implementation when possible, passing verification was recorded after implementation, post-refactor verification was recorded, and any missing-test exception is explicitly justified.
- A task cannot move to `Reviewed` unless verification was attempted.
- If verification cannot run, the task can be `Needs Human Review`, not `Done`.
- A task cannot be `Done` unless every required acceptance criterion is checked `[x]`.
- If any acceptance result is `[ ]` or `[~]`, the task must be `Blocked` or `Needs Human Review`.
- If required iteration evidence is missing, the task cannot be `Done` and workflow health must be `Partial` or `Failed`.

Acceptance results use:

```md
Acceptance result:
- [x] Criterion met
- [ ] Criterion not met
- [~] Partially met with notes
```

Copy or summarize acceptance results in `_progress/progress.md`.

Tasks should be Ralph Wiggum-style: small, literal, sequential, and easy to verify.

Continue to the next task automatically only when the current task is `Done` after Build -> Refine -> Polish. For code-changing tasks, each Build, Refine, and Polish iteration must embed TDD-first Red -> Green -> Refactor evidence:

- Red phase: write or update the relevant failing test first, run it, and record the expected failure.
- Green phase: implement the smallest in-scope change to pass, run the relevant tests, and record the pass.
- Refactor phase: clean structure, naming, and types without changing behavior, run the relevant tests again, and record that they still pass.
- Missing-test exception: if a failing test cannot reasonably be written or observed first, document why before implementation and record the best available verification.

Stop if a task is `Blocked`, `Needs Human Review`, remains failed after iteration-level failure recovery, becomes risky or unclear, lacks required TDD evidence for code-changing work, or requires external access.

## Parallel Task Rules

When planning for `parallel-workflow`, the orchestrator must rank tasks by priority and mark each task as parallel-safe or not. P0 tasks are claimed before P1 tasks, and P1 tasks are claimed before P2 tasks. Among same-priority tasks, choose the task with the lowest dependency risk and lowest merge risk first.

Every parallel-safe task must declare file locks before any worker edits files. No two workers may claim tasks with overlapping file locks. If file overlap appears unexpectedly, the worker stops, marks the task `needs-review`, and records the conflict in `_parallel/claims.md`, `_parallel/locks.md`, `_progress/progress.md`, and `_handoff/current.md`.

Worker count rules:

- Default worker agents: 3.
- Minimum parallel workers: 2 when 2 or more parallel-safe unblocked tasks exist.
- Maximum worker agents: 5.
- Fallback worker count: 1 only when dependency or file-lock safety requires sequential execution.

Each `parallel-worker` claims exactly one task, completes Build -> Refine -> Polish, records final status, releases locks only after final status is recorded, and stops.

## Dirty Worktree Protection

Before implementation, run:

```bash
git status --short
```

Document existing dirty files, files planned for the workflow, and overlap risk. If dirty files overlap with planned files, stop and ask before editing. If dirty files are unrelated, continue but document them. Never overwrite user changes or clean/reset files unless explicitly instructed.

## Failure Recovery

When verification fails, identify the failing command, capture the error, classify the failure as in-scope or unrelated, fix only in-scope failures, rerun the exact failing command, and stop with `Needs Human Review` if targeted recovery cannot prove the task.
