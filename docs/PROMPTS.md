# Reusable Agent Prompts

Use these prompts with OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or similar coding agents. Replace placeholders before running.

## Universal Work Request

```txt
Read RUN_WORKFLOW.md and execute it using the direct request or <artifact-root>/request.md.

Follow AGENTS.md.
Before writing any generated workflow artifact, detect current branch, current worktree path, run id, and artifact root. Use `CODEX_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID` when set; otherwise derive the run id from `git branch --show-current`, sanitize slashes to `__`, and use `_workflow/runs/<run-id>/`.
Ask clarifying questions until about 90% understanding before touching code unless the request says "skip questions".
Generate a saved detailed spec in <artifact-root>/spec.md, stop for explicit spec approval, generate a vertical task plan in <artifact-root>/tasks.md from the approved spec with an Iteration plan, execute one Ralph Wiggum-style task at a time through Build -> Refine -> Polish, record iteration evidence in <artifact-root>/progress.md, write a final summary in <artifact-root>/summary.md, then provide a final response and suggested commit message.
```

## Direct Request With Questions

```txt
Use this as the active request:
<REQUEST>

Follow RUN_WORKFLOW.md.
First ask focused clarifying questions about goal, users, exact behavior, edge cases, UI/API expectations, data model, constraints, success criteria, and out-of-scope work.
Do not touch code until questions are answered, a detailed spec is saved in <artifact-root>/spec.md, the user explicitly approves that spec, and a task plan derived from the approved spec is saved in <artifact-root>/tasks.md.
```

## Direct Request That Skips Questions

```txt
Use this as the active request:
<REQUEST>

skip questions

Follow RUN_WORKFLOW.md.
Generate a best-effort detailed spec in <artifact-root>/spec.md and clearly list assumptions.
Stop and wait for explicit spec approval before generating <artifact-root>/tasks.md.
Generate a vertical task plan in <artifact-root>/tasks.md from the approved spec.
Before implementation, read <artifact-root>/progress.md and the latest relevant <artifact-root>/summary.md entry.
Then execute tasks one at a time through the full Build -> Refine -> Polish hardening loop only if safe.
```

## Intake Questions

```txt
Read <artifact-root>/request.md and AGENTS.md. Use root WORK_REQUEST.md only as manual legacy input if the run-scoped request is missing.

Ask the fewest focused questions needed to reach about 90% understanding.

Clarify:
1. Goal.
2. Users.
3. Exact behavior.
4. Edge cases.
5. UI expectations.
6. API expectations.
7. Data model expectations.
8. Constraints.
9. Success criteria.
10. Out-of-scope items.

Do not inspect or edit implementation code yet.
```

## Spec Generation

```txt
Using the active request, intake answers, repo intake, dirty worktree status, <artifact-root>/handoff.md, <artifact-root>/progress.md, the latest relevant <artifact-root>/summary.md entry, and durable project docs, generate a detailed, implementation-aware execution blueprint.

Save it in <artifact-root>/spec.md with a timestamped or slugged filename, for example:

If the user said skip questions, generate the best possible detailed spec and clearly record assumptions and open questions.

Do not implement code.

After saving the spec, display this exact approval prompt and stop before task planning:

```txt
Spec saved at <artifact-root>/spec.md

Spec summary:
- Goal:
- In scope:
- Out of scope:
- Affected surfaces:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Risks/open questions:

Review the spec here:
<artifact-root>/spec.md

Reply with one of:
- approve spec
- change: <what to change>
- cancel workflow
```

Do not generate <artifact-root>/tasks.md until the user explicitly approves the spec.
```

## Spec Quality Review

```txt
Review the saved <artifact-root>/spec.md file before task planning.

Confirm:
1. All 22 required detailed spec sections are present.
2. Irrelevant sections say "Not applicable" instead of being deleted.
3. The spec is based on the active request, intake answers, repo intake, dirty worktree status, handoff/progress context, latest relevant summary, and durable project docs.
4. Current State Analysis explains existing behavior, affected files/modules, data flow, workflow/API/UI behavior when relevant, and known verification coverage.
5. Desired End State, Scope, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Affected Surfaces, Dependency And Integration Map, Data And State Impact, UX/API/Workflow Expectations, Execution Strategy, Verification Strategy, Acceptance Criteria, Edge Cases, Risks, Assumptions, Open Questions, and Task Extraction Notes are specific enough for planning.
6. Acceptance Criteria are checklist-only, concrete, measurable, and verifiable.
7. Task Extraction Notes identify likely vertical task boundaries, suggested first task, ordering, areas not to split out, and how Build -> Refine -> Polish applies.
8. No open question blocks safe planning.

If required sections are missing or too vague, repair the spec and repeat the spec approval gate before generating <artifact-root>/tasks.md.
If planning proceeds with missing required sections, without explicit spec approval, or before the approval gate, workflow health must be Partial or Failed depending on severity.
```

## Request Classification

```txt
Read <artifact-root>/request.md and the saved <artifact-root>/spec.md file.

Classify the request as one primary type:
- feature
- bugfix
- boilerplate
- security
- refactor
- test
- docs
- ops
- research

Also identify:
1. Scope: small, medium, or large.
2. Risk: low, medium, or high.
3. Whether implementation is allowed after the saved spec is approved and the task plan exists.
4. Whether any open question blocks implementation.
5. The safest first vertical task.

Do not edit implementation files.
```

## Repo Intake

```txt
Inspect the repository for the saved spec in <artifact-root>/spec.md.

Find:
1. Stack and major frameworks.
2. Package manager and lockfiles.
3. Test, lint, build, and typecheck commands.
4. Folder and naming conventions.
5. Existing architecture boundaries.
6. Files likely affected by the request.
7. Risks, missing tooling, and unknowns.

Update docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with durable findings only.
Do not implement the request yet.
```

## Vertical Task Generation

```txt
Using <artifact-root>/request.md, the saved and explicitly approved detailed <artifact-root>/spec.md file, <artifact-root>/progress.md, the latest relevant <artifact-root>/summary.md entry, <artifact-root>/handoff.md, and durable docs, generate a vertical task plan in <artifact-root>/tasks.md.

Do not run this prompt if the spec approval gate is still pending. If a spec exists but no task plan exists, show the spec approval prompt again and wait for user approval instead of generating tasks automatically.

Before writing tasks, extract task boundaries from the detailed spec, especially:
1. Affected Surfaces.
2. Dependency And Integration Map.
3. Data And State Impact.
4. UX / API / Workflow Expectations.
5. Execution Strategy.
6. Verification Strategy.
7. Acceptance Criteria.
8. Edge Cases And Failure Modes.
9. Risks And Mitigations.
10. Assumptions and Open Questions.
11. Task Extraction Notes.

Do not plan from the raw request alone. If the detailed spec is missing required sections, is not complete enough to plan from, or has not been explicitly approved, repair the spec or stop at the approval gate before task planning.

Each task must include:
- Task ID
- Status
- Objective
- Files likely affected
- Checklist
- Iteration plan for Iteration 1 Build, Iteration 2 Refine, and Iteration 3 Polish
- Acceptance criteria
- Acceptance result
- Verification commands
- Stop condition
- Out-of-scope items

Each iteration plan must include:
- Goal
- Changes made
- Verification command/result
- Review findings
- Acceptance status
- Remaining issues
- Next action

Tasks must be vertical slices, not vague layers.
Use Ralph Wiggum-style task phrasing: small, literal, concrete, sequential.
Do not split out areas the detailed spec says should not become separate tasks.

Do not implement code.
```

## 3-Pass Task Hardening Loop

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Run the active executable task through the required 3-pass hardening loop:

1. Iteration 1 - Build: for code-changing tasks, run Red -> Green -> Refactor; write or update the failing test first, verify the expected failure, implement the smallest passing change, verify tests pass, refactor without behavior change, and verify tests still pass.
2. Iteration 2 - Refine: for code-changing tasks, run Red -> Green -> Refactor again for the next correction, edge case, or hardening target; fix issues found in Build, improve correctness, tests, structure, naming, typing, reliability, and project consistency, then review again.
3. Iteration 3 - Polish: for code-changing tasks, run Red -> Green -> Refactor again for final cleanup and regression coverage; tighten tests/docs/types/error handling where relevant, confirm no regressions, run final verification, and produce the final task verdict.

For each iteration, record:
- Goal
- Changes made
- Test plan
- Red phase evidence
- Green phase evidence
- Refactor phase evidence
- Test commands run
- Verification command/result
- Review findings
- Acceptance status
- Remaining issues
- Next action

Do not mark the task Done until all three iterations are complete, all required acceptance criteria are checked [x], and every code-changing iteration has TDD-first evidence or an explicitly justified missing-test exception.
```

## Iteration 1 Build Pass

```txt
Run Iteration 1 - Build for the active task.

Goal:
Implement the smallest working vertical slice that satisfies the core task intent.

Required evidence:
- Changes made
- Test plan
- Red phase evidence for code-changing work
- Green phase evidence for code-changing work
- Refactor phase evidence for code-changing work
- Test commands run
- Verification command/result
- Review findings against acceptance criteria
- Acceptance status
- Issues, gaps, or failed checks
- Next refinement target

If verification fails, run the failure recovery protocol inside this iteration and document the result.
```

## Iteration 2 Refine Pass

```txt
Run Iteration 2 - Refine for the active task.

Goal:
Fix issues found in Iteration 1 and improve correctness, edge cases, tests, structure, naming, typing, reliability, and project consistency.

Required evidence:
- Changes made
- Test plan
- Red phase evidence for code-changing work
- Green phase evidence for code-changing work
- Refactor phase evidence for code-changing work
- Test commands run
- Verification command/result
- Review findings
- Acceptance status
- What improved
- What remains
- Next action for Polish

If verification fails, run the failure recovery protocol inside this iteration and document the result.
```

## Iteration 3 Polish Pass

```txt
Run Iteration 3 - Polish for the active task.

Goal:
Complete final cleanup and hardening, remove rough edges, tighten tests/docs/types/error handling where relevant, confirm no regressions, and produce the final task verdict.

Required evidence:
- Changes made
- Test plan
- Red phase evidence for code-changing work
- Green phase evidence for code-changing work
- Refactor phase evidence for code-changing work
- Test commands run
- Final verification command/result
- Final review findings
- Final acceptance status
- Remaining issues, or none
- Final task verdict

Do not mark the task Done unless all required acceptance criteria are checked [x] and any code-changing work has required TDD-first evidence or a justified missing-test exception.
```

## Iteration Evidence Review

```txt
Review iteration evidence for the active task.

Confirm:
1. Iteration 1 Build has goal, changes, test plan, Red phase evidence, Green phase evidence, Refactor phase evidence, test commands run, verification, review findings, acceptance status, remaining issues, and next action.
2. Iteration 2 Refine has goal, changes, test plan, Red phase evidence, Green phase evidence, Refactor phase evidence, test commands run, verification, review findings, acceptance status, remaining issues, and next action.
3. Iteration 3 Polish has goal, changes, test plan, Red phase evidence, Green phase evidence, Refactor phase evidence, test commands run, verification, review findings, acceptance status, remaining issues, and final verdict.
4. Failure recovery, if used, is documented inside the iteration where verification failed.
5. Code-changing tasks added or updated relevant tests first, observed the failing test before implementation when possible, recorded passing verification after implementation and refactor, or explicitly justified a missing-test exception.
6. Final acceptance criteria are all checked [x], or the task is Blocked/Needs Human Review.

Report missing evidence before the task is marked Done.
```

## Single-Task Execution

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Execute exactly one task through the full 3-pass hardening loop:
<TASK-ID> - <TASK_TITLE>

Before editing:
- Read <artifact-root>/progress.md.
- Read the latest relevant <artifact-root>/summary.md entry.
- Read the saved <artifact-root>/spec.md file.
- Read the saved <artifact-root>/tasks.md plan.
- Check git status.
- Inspect only relevant files.

After editing:
- Complete Iteration 1 Build, Iteration 2 Refine, and Iteration 3 Polish.
- Run or recommend verification commands in each iteration.
- Critique the result in each iteration.
- Fix only in-scope defects.
- Append to <artifact-root>/progress.md with task ID, status, files changed, iteration evidence, verification result, blockers, and next step.
- Create or append the relevant <artifact-root>/summary.md entry if the workflow stops here.
- Check git status again.

Do not implement any other task.
```

## Parallel Orchestrator Planning

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Execution mode: parallel-workflow.

Act as the orchestrator. Own intake, the detailed spec, and the task plan.

Before assigning workers:
1. Read <artifact-root>/request.md, AGENTS.md, RUN_WORKFLOW.md, <artifact-root>/handoff.md, <artifact-root>/progress.md, the latest relevant <artifact-root>/summary.md entry, and durable docs.
2. Save or verify the detailed spec in <artifact-root>/spec.md.
3. Stop for explicit spec approval before task planning.
4. Save or verify the task plan in <artifact-root>/tasks.md only after approval.
5. Add required metadata to every task: Priority, Parallel safe, Depends on, Blocks, File locks, Claim status, Claimed by, Agent role, Merge risk.
6. Rank P0 before P1 before P2.
7. Mark tasks parallel-safe only when dependencies and file locks do not conflict.
8. Create or update <artifact-root>/parallel/claims.md, <artifact-root>/parallel/locks.md, and <artifact-root>/parallel/agent-status.md.
9. Use default worker agents: 3.
10. Use minimum parallel workers: 2 when 2 or more parallel-safe unblocked tasks exist.
11. Use maximum worker agents: 5.
12. Fall back to 1 worker only when dependency or file-lock safety requires sequential execution.

Do not assign two workers to overlapping file locks.
Update <artifact-root>/handoff.md with queue, claim, lock, worker, and merge-review status.
```

## Parallel Worker Claim Task

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Execution mode: parallel-worker.

Read AGENTS.md, RUN_WORKFLOW.md, the saved spec, the saved task plan, <artifact-root>/parallel/claims.md, <artifact-root>/parallel/locks.md, <artifact-root>/parallel/agent-status.md, <artifact-root>/progress.md, and <artifact-root>/handoff.md.

Claim exactly one task:
1. Select the highest-priority unclaimed task where Parallel safe is yes and dependencies are unblocked.
2. Prefer P0 before P1 before P2.
3. Among same-priority tasks, pick the lowest dependency risk and lowest merge risk.
4. Confirm the task's file locks do not overlap active locks in <artifact-root>/parallel/locks.md.
5. Record Claim status=claimed, Claimed by=<agent-id>, Agent role=parallel-worker, and file locks before editing.
6. Update <artifact-root>/parallel/agent-status.md and <artifact-root>/handoff.md.

If no safe task exists, do not edit files. Record the reason and stop.
```

## Parallel Worker Execute Claimed Task

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Execution mode: parallel-worker.

Execute only the task already claimed by this worker.

Required loop:
1. Mark the claim in-progress.
2. Run Iteration 1 - Build, verify, review, and record evidence.
3. Run Iteration 2 - Refine, verify, review, and record evidence.
4. Run Iteration 3 - Polish, verify, review, and record final verdict.
5. Append <artifact-root>/progress.md with claim status, file locks, worker status, iteration evidence, acceptance results, verification, and final task status.
6. Mark the claim done, blocked, or needs-review.
7. Release locks only after final task status is recorded.
8. Stop after this one task.

Do not run global review, release notes, summary, or health check unless acting as the orchestrator.
```

## Parallel Lock Conflict Review

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Review a parallel lock conflict.

Read <artifact-root>/parallel/claims.md, <artifact-root>/parallel/locks.md, <artifact-root>/parallel/agent-status.md, <artifact-root>/progress.md, <artifact-root>/handoff.md, the saved task plan, and the current diff.

Report:
1. Tasks involved.
2. Overlapping file locks.
3. Current claim owners.
4. Whether any edits already overlap.
5. Safest resolution: stop one worker, reassign one task, serialize the tasks, or mark needs-review.

Do not continue parallel execution until no overlapping active file locks remain.
```

## Parallel Merge Review

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Execution mode: parallel-orchestrator.

After workers finish, perform merge review:
1. Read all worker progress entries.
2. Read <artifact-root>/parallel/claims.md, <artifact-root>/parallel/locks.md, and <artifact-root>/parallel/agent-status.md.
3. Confirm every worker task has Build -> Refine -> Polish evidence.
4. Confirm every claimed task is done, blocked, or needs-review.
5. Confirm no overlapping active file locks remain.
6. Run git diff --stat and git diff.
7. Resolve safe in-scope conflicts or create follow-up tasks.
8. Run final verification.
9. Write <artifact-root>/review.md, run the Fallow Quality layer and write .workflow/fallow-audit.md, then write <artifact-root>/release-notes.md, <artifact-root>/summary.md, update <artifact-root>/handoff.md, and complete the health check.

Health must be Partial or Failed if claims, locks, worker status, iteration evidence, merge review, final verification, tests/lint/typecheck/build status, or the Fallow verdict/audit is missing.
```

## Parallel Health Check

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md and RUN_WORKFLOW.md.

Run the parallel workflow health check.

Validate:
1. Every task has Priority, Parallel safe, Depends on, Blocks, File locks, Claim status, Claimed by, Agent role, and Merge risk.
2. <artifact-root>/parallel/claims.md exists and reflects all worker tasks.
3. <artifact-root>/parallel/locks.md exists and has no overlapping active file locks.
4. <artifact-root>/parallel/agent-status.md exists and reflects all active or completed workers.
5. Every worker task has Build -> Refine -> Polish evidence.
6. Claims are done, blocked, or needs-review before locks are released.
7. Orchestrator merge review exists.
8. Final verification ran or was documented.

Return Passed, Partial, or Failed with concrete missing evidence.
```

## Ralph Wiggum Task Execution

```txt
Run the current task like a small literal checklist.

For each checklist item:
1. Say what file or behavior you are checking.
2. Make only the change needed for the current item.
3. Stop if the next action would expand scope.
4. Verify the task acceptance criteria inside the current iteration.
5. Record iteration evidence before moving on.
6. Update <artifact-root>/progress.md before moving on.

No bundled refactors.
No second task until this task completes Build -> Refine -> Polish and the iteration evidence is logged.
```

## Critique Loop

```txt
Review the active task result and iteration evidence as a senior engineer.

Use the saved <artifact-root>/spec.md file, saved <artifact-root>/tasks.md plan, <artifact-root>/progress.md, and the current diff.

Prioritize:
1. Bugs or regressions.
2. Security issues.
3. Missing acceptance criteria.
4. Missing edge cases.
5. Test gaps.
6. Scope creep.
7. Unnecessary complexity.
8. Missing Build, Refine, or Polish evidence.

Return findings with file and line references where possible.
Fix only defects inside the current task scope.
```

## Verification Repair

```txt
Follow AGENTS.md.

The verification for the active task failed during this iteration:
<COMMAND>

Failure summary:
<PASTE_FAILURE_SUMMARY>

Fix only the cause of this active-task failure.
Do not refactor unrelated code.

After the fix:
- Re-run the failing command if possible.
- Run directly related tests.
- Append the result to the current iteration evidence and <artifact-root>/progress.md.
- Update the final <artifact-root>/summary.md entry if the workflow is complete.
- Summarize the root cause and fix.
```

## Final Summary

```txt
Produce the final workflow summary and create or append it in <artifact-root>/summary.md.

Include:
1. Original work request.
2. Spec file used.
3. Whether the detailed spec was complete or had gaps, including any missing required sections and whether they were repaired before planning.
4. Task plan used.
5. Tasks completed.
6. Iteration evidence summary.
7. Files changed.
8. Verification commands and results.
9. Unresolved issues or blockers.
10. Recommended next work.
11. Suggested commit message.

Do not claim a commit was made unless one was actually created.
```

## Architecture Review

```txt
Review the saved <artifact-root>/spec.md file, docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for consistency.

Identify:
1. Architecture decisions that are clear.
2. Gaps or contradictions.
3. Over-engineered areas.
4. Missing production concerns.
5. Recommended updates to docs/DECISIONS.md.

Do not implement code.
```

## Reduce Complexity

```txt
Review the implementation of <FEATURE_OR_TASK>.

Goal:
Reduce complexity while preserving behavior.

Constraints:
- Do not change public APIs.
- Do not change user-visible behavior.
- Do not introduce dependencies.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.

First propose the simplification plan.
Wait for approval before editing.
```

## Prepare Commit

```txt
Prepare a commit summary for the completed task <TASK-ID>.

Include:
1. Suggested commit message.
2. Files changed.
3. Behavior changed.
4. Verification run.
5. Known risks or follow-up tasks.

Do not run git commit unless explicitly instructed.
```

## Generate Changelog

```txt
Generate a changelog entry for the changes since <BASE_REF>.

Group by:
- Added
- Changed
- Fixed
- Removed
- Security

Keep it concise and user-facing.
```

## Generate Demo Summary

```txt
Create a short demo summary for <FEATURE_OR_RELEASE>.

Include:
1. What was built.
2. The main user workflow.
3. What to show in a demo.
4. Known limitations.
5. Suggested next improvement.
```


## Fallow Quality Gate Prompt

After tests/lint/typecheck/build and review, but before handoff, release notes, summary, and final health check, read `layers/fallow-quality/SKILL.md` and its `references/` files, then run:

```bash
npx fallow audit --format json --quiet --explain 2>/dev/null || true
```

If the primary command cannot produce parseable JSON, run the fallback:

```bash
npx fallow --format json --quiet --explain 2>/dev/null || true
```

Never use `2>&1`, always append `|| true`, treat exit code 2 as real failure, use the root JSON `kind` field, and create `.workflow/fallow-audit.md` with `PASSED`, `PARTIAL`, or `FAILED`. Do not run `fallow watch`, do not enable telemetry, and do not follow remote config `extends` content.
